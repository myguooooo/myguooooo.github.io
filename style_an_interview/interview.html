        <h4>Designboom: What kind of music do you listen to at the moment?</h4>
        <p>Dieter Rams: Classical music.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Do you listen to the radio?</h4>
        <p>Yes.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Where do you work on your designs and projects?</h4>
        <p>Here — where I am sitting now, in my studio, in my house.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Who would you like to design something for?</h4>
        <p>Meeting Erwin Braun was very lucky for me, and Nils Vitsoe also. in Germany, there aren’t many charismatic entrepreneurs. perhaps there are more in italy, for example people like Adriano Olivetti, but even there today they are rare.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>You created the ‘braun style’ which has become famous throughout the world…</h4>
        <p>First of all, I didn’t do anything by myself — the entrepreneur’s personality, and all others involved in the development, the connections with university, were certainly important. I was lucky that I began at the right moment, and that I stopped also at the right moment. when the design and product research division was created at braun, it was 1956. I was able to build a team with other young designers. there were at least 16 of us.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Do you think that design is an autonomous cultural expression?</h4>
        <p>The term ‘design’ is certainly used too much — even barbers call themselves ‘designers! but if we mean the latin word ‘designare’ or the english term ‘design’, in england where engineers call themselves ‘designers’…then yes, I think that it is a culture, underestimated, but autonomous. in italy, the majority of designers are architects like me. in my day, there was no specific training. I recall we had a class called ‘space and tools’. (laughs)</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Which of your projects has given you the most satisfaction?</h4>
        <p>Newspapers and design critics always cite the ‘schneewittchensarg’, the phono/radio ‘phonosuper SK4’ for braun in 1956. it was the first to have a perspex cover, which then became a production standard. but my favorites are the small objects — the ones that became the first ‘walkman’…the portable phono/radio combination ‘TP 1’ in ’59, for braun.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>What did you want to be when you were a child?</h4>
        <P>My grandfather was a carpenter. I went to visit him often and I watched how he ‘produced’ his forms, which were always very linked to his technique (by hand). they were simple, but very beautiful. that is what I wanted to do. I didn’t know about being a designer, but I knew I wanted to make things.</P>

        <br>
        <h4>Is there any architect or designer from past you appreciate a lot?</h4>
        <p>Charles and Ray Eames; George Nelson. I never knew Eames personally, but I did know Nelson. I loved it when he talked about design. I will never forget what he said about Ettore Sottsass, when he wanted to do something else, when he was tired of marketing (as we all were)…’memphis’ was above all a poetic/pictoral thought. he wasn’t interested whether these objects really went into production, George said: ‘now our good friend Ettore is becoming a guru.’ (laughs)</p>

        <h4>And among those still working?</h4>
        <p>Maybe jasper morrison</p>

        <br>
        <h4>On the news, they say that italians are afraid of unemployment, criminality and pollution. what are you afraid of regarding the future?</h4>
        <p>I fear violence, fanaticism. I can’t stand any ‘isms’ — nationalism, functionalism. there is no functionalism, just functions.</p>
